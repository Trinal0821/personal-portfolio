    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a student at the University of Utah majoring in computer science. I've been passiong about going 
      into computer science since I was a kid. My mom used to have co-worker who was studying computer science
      at that time and he showed me a game that he created. I thought it was super cool how he was able to create
      a game from scratch and I was inspired to create something like that. So I decided that I wanted to get a 
      career in the field. Ever since then, I've been honing my problem solving skills, communications skills and
      coding skills. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This summer, I had that opportunity to work at a nonprofit program called Code to Sucess as a College Mentor. 
      This organization teach students from grade 6-12 how to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Some of my job duties
      include: teaching students to use git, github, and the terminal, how to debug code and host week cohort meetings with 
      students. From this opportunity, I was able to improve my communications and leadership skills. Overall all, I was able a
      lot of invaluable skills as well as the organizations. Even though this opportunity only lasted about 6 weeks, I hope to 
      return back next year and the organization more.
